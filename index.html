        <h4>About us: Our Story and Mission</h4>
        <p id="upper_text">
          We explored various aspects of cryptocurrencies, including using
          Bitcoin for payments, mining, and trading with different strategies.
          We also considered starting a company and extensively researched
          Ethereum and smart contracts. However, we struggled to find a viable
          business model. Concerns about government intervention and the
          potential ban of Bitcoin always lingered. As a result, we pursued
          other entrepreneurial ventures and found some validation when the ICO
          wave ended with a crash.
        </p>
        <p id="lower_text">
          The positive developments in 2020 took us by surprise. The influx of
          capital from established institutions, including the financial
          industry, made it increasingly challenging for the government to ban
          Bitcoin. However, we acknowledge that they may still attempt to do so.
          Recently, when we attempted to transfer our old, now more valuable
          Bitcoin and Ether to a new wallet, we discovered that we had lost
          access to them completely. We were unable to locate our wallets in the
          first place.

              By a stupid mistake, I wrote down only 11 of 12 words of my seed
              phrase. Desperately I tried it myself but gave up after a short
              time. By chance, I came across ReWallet and asked if it would be
              possible to restore access to my wallet. Shorthand later we
              arranged a meeting in Berlin for the delivery of the seed phrase.
              About 4 weeks later I got the email that they have restored the
              access. Guys, you are great, we need people like you.

              I had pretty much written off my lost wallet until I came across
              ReWallet in forums. The good reviews prompted me to make an
              inquiry on the ReWallet site. At first, I was skeptical. But that
              was quickly dispelled. Promptly came a response, and it was probed
              whether a recovery of my wallet possible. After about 1 week came
              the positive news. Then everything went quickly and I was back in
              possession of my Wallet.
